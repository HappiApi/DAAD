There are different classes of polygons and there exists 'specialised algorithms' 
to solve specific classes better than the 'textbook' algorithm 

## Star-shaped polygons
the whole interior is visible from a single point, without crossing any edge. The polygon must be simple, and may be convex or concave.

## Algorithm to check if polygon is star shaped

## Decomposing Polygon to Star-shaped polygons

### Some other polygon stuff
Convex Polygon - No interior angle > 180 deg
Concave Polygon - At least one interior angle > 180 deg 
Simple: the boundary of the polygon does not cross itself. All convex polygons are simple.
